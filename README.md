# GitHub Topic Explorer

## General information

This is a ReactJS webapp, and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
Unfortunately, I'm still learning about Unit Test with Jest, so this section will be unable to run.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Notes from Yama

1. API KEY for GitHub GraphQL API its on env file. Feel free to use it to test the application.
2. Implemented a pair of styled components. The search fieldtext and button.
3. Implemented React Apollo to consume GraphQL API.
4. Implemented some styles via SASS.
5. Tried to give a decent UI Design.

App its deployed on Heroku, you can access from your PC/MAC or your mobile device ;)
